FarmCast
FarmCast is an innovative web application designed to help farmers manage their agricultural activities more efficiently. Leveraging real-time weather data, the application provides insights and reminders for key farming tasks, aiming to enhance productivity and reduce losses due to adverse weather conditions.

FarmCast was conceived in response to the challenges faced by farmers in managing time-sensitive agricultural activities. The idea emerged after personal experiences with rice farming, where unanticipated weather changes led to significant losses. FarmCast aims to provide farmers with a tool to better plan and execute their farming tasks, thereby improving efficiency and reducing risks.

Architecture
The architecture of FarmCast is designed to ensure seamless data flow and user interaction. Below is a high-level diagram of the architecture:

Frontend:

Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
Communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
Backend:

Developed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.
Handles API requests, data processing, and serves static files.
Data Integration:

Integrates with the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data.
Stores user data in an in-memory data structure (for this prototype).
Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For building the user interface.
No additional frameworks were used to keep the project simple and focus on core JavaScript skills.
Backend:

Flask: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in handling HTTP requests and serving as the applicationâ€™s backend.
API Integration:

OpenWeather API: Used to fetch real-time weather data and forecasts.
